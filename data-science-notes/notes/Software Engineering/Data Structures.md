# Data Structures

## Summary
Data structures are a fundamental concept in computer science and programming. They are specialized formats for organizing, storing, and managing data in a way that enables efficient access and modification.

What Are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data, such as databases or large-scale applications, and are essential for designing efficient algorithms.
Types of Data Structures
Data structures can be broadly categorized into two types:
Primitive Data Structures
These are basic data structures provided by programming languages.
Examples:
Integer: Stores whole numbers.
Float: Stores decimal numbers.
Character: Stores single characters.
Boolean: Stores true or false values.
Non-Primitive Data Structures
These are more complex structures built using primitive data types.
They are further divided into:
Linear Data Structures: Elements are arranged sequentially.
Non-Linear Data Structures: Elements are not arranged sequentially.

Common Data Structures
Some of the most widely used data structures:
a. Linear Data Structures
Arrays: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
Example: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Linked Lists: A sequence of nodes where each node points to the next.
Types: Singly linked list, doubly linked list, circular linked list.
Stacks: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
Operations: push (add), pop (remove), peek (view top element).
Queues: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.
